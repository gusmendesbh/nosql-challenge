Module 12 Challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating.
I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## What was created

This assignment consists of two technical products, with the following deliverables:

Setup: Update the Database - The magazine editors had some requested modifications for the database before I could perform any queries or analysis for them. Added a new restaurant and removed stablishments in the region of Dover.
Analysis: Exploratory Analysis - Eat Safe, Love had specific questions they wanted me to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.
